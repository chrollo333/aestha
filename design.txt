 Best Approach: Start with Content, Then Users
1️⃣ Step 1: Home Page + Content Display (Recommended First)
✔ Set up the homepage (/) with a grid of 8 daily outfits from the database.
✔ Ensure the API fetches outfits from your database and displays them in React.
✔ Basic navigation (Home, About, maybe a placeholder for "Login").
✔ This makes your site functional before worrying about user accounts.

2️⃣ Step 2: Add User System
✔ Create User model (username, email, password, profile pic, etc.).
✔ Sign-up & Login pages (integrate with Flask).
✔ JWT authentication (so users can stay logged in).
✔ User profile page (shows saved outfits, etc.).
✔ Let users "favorite" outfits (store favorites in the database).

3️⃣ Step 3: Interactive Features & AI Integration
✔ Users can upload their own outfits.
✔ Users can chat or comment on outfits.
✔ AI-powered recommendations (optional).

📌 Why Start with Content First?
People can explore outfits immediately without needing an account.
No empty pages—you won’t have a login page with no purpose.
Easier to test and develop without user authentication complexity.
You can add users later without breaking anything.
🚀 My Recommendation
Start with Step 1 → Build the home page with outfits first.
Once the content system works, add Step 2 (users, profiles, login).

HOMEPAGE

For the homepage, you could include:

A Hero Section: A big, stylish banner with a tagline like "Discover Fashion from Around the World" and a call-to-action button leading to the outfit page.
Brief Introduction: A short description of what Daily Fashion is about.
Trending Outfits: A small preview of the most liked outfits of the day.
User Testimonials or Community Highlights: If you plan to add user interaction, this could showcase top contributors.
Navigation to Other Pages: Clear links to the random outfits page, news section, and user profiles.
Would you like to add any interactive elements, like a daily fashion tip or a "What’s Your Style?" quiz?
